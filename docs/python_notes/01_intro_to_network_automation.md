## Introduction to Network Automation for Network Engineers

**Network automation** refers to using software to automate the setup,
management, testing, and operation of network devices like routers, switches,
and firewalls. By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, network
engineers can streamline operations, reduce human error, and maintain a more
efficient and scalable network infrastructure.

### Key Benefits of Network Automation:

- **Consistency**: Automation ensures that configurations are applied uniformly
  across devices, reducing the chance of errors that come from manual input.
- **Speed**: Automating tasks like configuration changes, software upgrades, or
  troubleshooting significantly reduces the time it takes to perform these
  tasks.
- **Scalability**: As networks grow, manual management becomes impractical.
  Automation allows for easy scaling by enabling mass deployment of
  configurations.
- **Reduced Downtime**: Automation can help quickly identify and resolve
  network issues, leading to better uptime and reduced service interruptions.

### Tools for Network Automation:

- **Ansible**: An open-source automation tool that uses playbooks written in
  YAML. It is simple to use, making it popular among network engineers for
  configuring network devices.
- **Python**: A versatile programming language widely used in network
  automation. Python libraries like `Netmiko` and `Nornir` simplify interacting
  with network devices.
- **Cisco DevNet**: Provides resources and sandboxes for testing automation
  scripts on Cisco devices.
- **Terraform**: Known for its infrastructure as code (IaC) capabilities, it's
  increasingly used for automating network resources in cloud environments.

### Typical Use Cases:

1. **Configuration Management**: Automating the application of configuration
   templates to routers, switches, and firewalls.
2. **Backup and Restore**: Scheduling regular backups of device configurations
   and automating the process of restoring configurations in case of failure.
3. **Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting**: Automating the collection of
   logs and network data, and performing automated troubleshooting actions when
   issues are detected.
4. **VLAN Management**: Automating the creation, deletion, and modification of
   VLANs across multiple switches.

### Getting Started with Network Automation:

For beginners, it's best to start with simple scripts using Python or Ansible
that perform tasks like gathering device information or applying
configurations. Building familiarity with these tools helps in understanding
more complex automation workflows and integrating them into a larger network
management strategy.

Network automation represents a shift in how network engineers manage
infrastructure, turning manual, tedious tasks into automated processes, thus
allowing engineers to focus more on optimizing and improving network
performance.
