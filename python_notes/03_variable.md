## Introduction to Variables

**Variables** are a fundamental concept in programming, serving as containers
to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. They are
used in every programming language and are essential for handling data in
applications.

### Key Characteristics of Variables:

- **Storage**: Variables store data temporarily in memory, allowing the program
  to access and manipulate it as needed.
- **Dynamic Typing in Python**: Python variables are *dynamically typed*,
  meaning that you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create
  it. The type is inferred based on the value assigned to it.

### Example of Variables in Python:

```python
name = "John"
# Output: 'John'

number = 10
# Output: 10

# Checking the memory address of variables
id(name)
# Output: 1759753155568

id(number)
# Output: 140720682367704
```

In this example:

- `name` stores a string value `"John"`.
- `number` stores an integer value `10`.
- `id()` function returns the memory address where the variable is stored.

### Updating Variables:

Variables in Python can be reassigned new values, and each time this happens,
the variable points to a new memory address:

```python
name = "Ali"
id(name)
# Output: 1759753175616
```

Here, the variable `name` is updated from `"John"` to `"Ali"`, resulting in a
change in its memory address, as Python creates a new object for the updated
value.

Variables are crucial for storing and manipulating data in programs. Pythonâ€™s
dynamic typing and ease of use make handling variables straightforward,
allowing for quick development and flexibility.
