# Network Automation

--------------------

What is Network Automation?

Network automation is the process of automating the configuration, management
and operations of a computer network. The
tasks that were normally done by the network or system administrator can be
automated using a number of tools and
technologies.

Scripting languages are widely used by Network and System administrators for
automating the tasks. This saves time,
effort and thereby reducing human errors as well. Among the automation tools,
Python and Ansible are the most popular
ones. With Software Defined Networking (SDN) in picture, knowing any of these
programming languages is vital for the
future of administering the network and systems.
